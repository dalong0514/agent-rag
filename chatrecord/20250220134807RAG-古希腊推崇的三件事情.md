古希腊推崇的三件事情

[answer]:



古希腊所推崇的三件事是**真理（truth）、美（beauty）和正义（justice）**。这一观点在上下文中被明确提及，并引发了对语言表达局限性的反思：

1. **真理**  
   古希腊人将真理视为核心追求，但正如《圣经》中“什么是真理？”的追问所示，真理的本质难以用语言完全定义。数学、哲学等领域对真理的探索也揭示了符号系统的局限性（如非欧几何的发现）。

2. **美**  
   美被古希腊人高度推崇，但其评判标准同样无法被语言完全捕捉。材料指出，除了选美评委外，无人敢轻易断言“美”的标准，暗示美的主观性与不可言说性。

3. **正义**  
   自汉谟拉比法典以来，人类试图用法律条文定义正义，但法律往往与个人对正义的直觉存在偏差。古希腊人将正义视为理想，但其内涵在实践和理论中始终充满争议。

**深层意义**：  
这三者被古希腊视为人类精神的核心价值，但它们的不可言说性（如音乐、诗歌传递的“无法用文字表达的内涵”）呼应了后文对符号系统局限性的讨论（如哥德尔定理）。材料强调，伟大人物能够容忍这种“模糊性”，在相信与怀疑之间寻求突破，这与古希腊哲学中辩证思考的精神一脉相承。

It is not evident, though many people, from the early Greeks on, implicitly act as if it were true, that all things, whatsoever they may be, can be put into words—you could talk about anything: the gods, truth, beauty, and justice. But if you consider what happens in a music concert, then it is obvious that what is transmitted to the audience cannot be put into words—if it could, then the composer and musicians would probably have used words. All the music critics to the contrary, what music communicates cannot (apparently) be put into words. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, for painting. Poetry is a curious field where words are used but the true content of the poem is not in the words!

我想以一些更令人深思的想法来结尾。虽然许多人，从早期的希腊人开始，就隐约地认为所有事物 —— 无论它们是什么 —— 都可以用语言来表达，仿佛你可以谈论任何事情：神、真理、美和正义。但如果你想想音乐会上发生的事情，就会发现传递给听众的感受是无法用言语来表达的。如果可以，作曲家和音乐家们可能早就用文字来表达了。与那些音乐评论家的看法相反，音乐所传递的（显然）无法用语言来描述。绘画也是如此，只是程度稍轻。诗歌则是一种独特的领域，虽然使用了文字，但诗歌真正的内涵却并非完全存在于文字之中！

Similarly, the three things of Classical Greece, truth, beauty, and justice, though you all think you know what they mean, cannot (apparently) be put into words. From the time of Hammurabi, the attempt to put justice into words has produced the law, and often the law is not your conception of justice. There is the famous question in the Bible, "What is truth?" And who but a beauty judge would dare to judge "beauty"?

同样，古希腊所推崇的三件事 —— 真理、美和正义，尽管你们都自认为理解它们的含义，却（似乎）难以用言语清晰地表达。自汉谟拉比时代起，人们便尝试用文字来定义正义，由此产生了法律，但法律的定义往往与你所理解的正义有所偏差。《圣经》中就有一个著名的问题：「什么是真理？」而除了选美评委，又有谁敢妄下断言，评判「美」呢？

Thus I have gone beyond the limitations of Gödel's theorem, which loosely states that if you have a reasonably rich system of discrete symbols (the theorem does not refer to mathematics in spite of the way it is usually presented), then there will be statements whose truth or falsity cannot be proved within the system. It follows that if you add new assumptions to settle these theorems, there will be new theorems which you cannot settle within the new enlarged system. This indicates a clear limitation on what discrete symbol systems can do.

Great people can tolerate ambiguity; they can both believe and disbelieve at the same time. You must be able to believe your organization and field of research is the best there is, but also that there is much room for improvement! You can sort of see why this is a necessary trait. If you believe too much, you will not likely see the chances for significant improvements; if you do not believe enough, you will be filled with doubts and get very little done, chances are only the 2%, 5%, and 10% improvements. I have not the faintest idea of how to teach the tolerance of ambiguity, both belief and disbelief at the same time, but great people do it all the time.

关于伟大人物，我必须谈谈他们的另一个特质 —— 而我对此也经过了漫长的思考才意识到。伟大的人物能够容忍含糊不清；他们可以同时持有相信和不相信的态度。你必须既坚信你的组织和研究领域是顶尖的，又认识到仍有巨大的进步空间！你或许可以理解这为何是必要的特质。如果你过于自信，就可能看不到重大改进的机遇；如果你不够自信，就会充满疑虑，导致一事无成，最终可能只有 2%、5% 甚至 10% 的小幅提升。我不清楚该如何教授这种对含糊不清的容忍能力，即同时保持相信和不相信的态度，但伟大人物一直都在践行这一点。

Most great people also have 10 to 20 problems they regard as basic and of great importance, and which they currently do not know how to solve. They keep them in their mind, hoping to get a clue as to how to solve them. When a clue does appear they generally drop other things and get to work immediately on the important problem. Therefore they tend to come in first, and the others who come in later are soon forgotten. I must warn you, however, that the importance of the result is not the measure of the importance of the problem. The three problems in physics—anti-gravity, teleportation, and time travel—are seldom worked on because we have so few clues as to how to start. A problem is important partly because there is a possible attack on it and not just because of its inherent importance.

大多数杰出的人都有 10 到 20 个他们认为基本且非常重要，但目前又不知道如何解决的问题。他们把这些问题放在心里，希望能找到解决的线索。一旦线索出现，他们通常会立刻放下手头其他的事情，着手解决这些重要的问题。因此，他们往往能取得领先，而后来者则容易被人们遗忘。不过，我必须提醒你，结果的重要性并不能作为衡量问题重要性的唯一标准。物理学中的三个难题 —— 反重力、瞬间移动和时间旅行 —— 很少有人研究，主要是因为我们几乎没有关于如何着手的线索。一个问题之所以重要，一部分原因在于它有可能被解决，而不仅仅是因为它本身的重要性。

There have been a number of times in this book when I came close to the point of saying it is not so much what you do as how you do it.

It has often been observed the true gain is in the struggle and not in the achievement—a life without a struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living. This, it must be observed, is an opinion and not a fact, but it is based on observing many people's lives and speculating on their total happiness rather than the moment-to-moment pleasures they enjoyed. Again, this opinion of their happiness must be my own interpretation as no one can know another's life. Many reports by people who have written about the "good life" agree with the above opinion. Notice I leave it to you to pick your goals of excellence, but claim only a life without such a goal is not really living but merely existing—in my opinion. In ancient Greece, Socrates (469–399 bc) said:

最后，从某种意义上说，这门课带有布道性质：我希望传达的是，既然我们每个人在地球上似乎只有一次生命，就应该努力为人类做出有意义的贡献，而不是仅仅为了舒适地活着。在某个领域追求卓越本身，就是人生一个值得追求的目标。人们常说，真正的收获在于奋斗的过程，而非最终的成就。如果一个人不努力让自己变得卓越，他的人生就很难说是真正有价值的。必须说明的是，这是一种观点，而非事实。这个观点基于对许多人生活的观察，以及对他们整体幸福感的推测，而不是他们所享受的短暂快乐。而且，我对他们幸福感的解读，也仅仅是我个人的理解，因为没有人能真正了解他人的生活。许多关于「美好生活」的著述都认同上述观点。请注意，我把选择追求卓越的目标留给你们自己，但我认为，没有这样目标的生活，并非真正的生活，而仅仅是活着。正如古希腊的苏格拉底（Socrates）(公元前 469–399 年）所说：

The unexamined life is not worth living.

不加反思的人生，是不值得过的。

Democritus (b. around 460 bc) said in ancient Greek times, "All is atoms and void." This is the stance of the hard ai people; there is no essential difference between machines and humans, hence by suitably programming machines, the machines can do anything humans can do. Their failures to produce thinking in significant detail is, they believe, merely the failure of programmers to understand what they are doing, and not an essential limitation.

物理学认为你是由辐射能场中的分子组成的集合，严格来说，从物理学的角度来看，仅此而已。德谟克利特（生于公元前 460 年左右）在古希腊时期就说过：「万物皆为原子与虚空」。这是强人工智能（hard ai）研究者的观点：机器和人类之间没有本质区别，因此，通过适当的编程，机器可以完成人类所能做的任何事情。他们认为，目前未能创造出足够精细的思维，仅仅是因为程序员尚未理解他们正在做的事情，而非存在本质上的局限。

At the other extreme of the ai scale, some of us, when considering our own feelings, believe we have self-awareness and self-consciousness—though we are not able to give satisfactory tests to prove these things exist. I can get a machine to print out "I have a soul" or "I am self-aware" or "I have self-consciousness," and you would not be impressed with such statements from a machine. But from humans you are inclined to give greater credence to such remarks, based on the belief that you, by introspection, feel you have such properties (things), and you have learned by long experience in life that other humans are similar to you—though clearly racism still exists, which asserts there are differences, me being always the better person!

在人工智能领域的另一端，当我们审视自身感受时，我们中的一些人相信自己拥有自我意识 —— 尽管我们无法拿出令人信服的证据来证明它的存在。我可以让机器打印出「我拥有灵魂」、「我具有自我意识」或「我能感知自我」这样的语句，但这并不会让你对机器产生任何特别的印象。然而，对于人类的类似表述，你往往会更倾向于相信，因为你通过内省，感觉自己拥有这些特质，并且通过长期的生活经验，你认为其他人与你相似。当然，种族主义依然存在，它宣称人与人之间存在差异，并认为「我」总是更优越的！

We are at a stalemate at this point in the discussion of ai; we can each assert as much as we please, but it proves nothing at all to most people. So let us turn to the record of ai successes and failures.

关于人工智能的讨论，我们现在陷入了僵局；每个人都可以随意发表自己的观点，但这对于大多数人来说并不能说明任何问题。因此，我们不妨来看看人工智能的成功与失败案例。

ai people have always made extravagant claims which have not been borne out—not even closely, in most cases. Newell and Simon in 1958 predicted that in ten years the next world champion in chess would be a computer program. Unfortunately similar, as yet unrealized, claims have been made by most of the ai leaders in the public eye. Still, startling results have been produced.

这并不意味着他们证明程序正确的方法毫无价值，只是，正如经常发生的那样，他们的说法有些言过其实。

Most mathematicians belong to the Platonic school when they are doing mathematics from day to day, but when pressed for a clear discussion of what they are doing, they usually take refuge in the formalist school and claim mathematics is an idle game with essentially no meaning to the symbols (not that they believe this, but it is a nice, defensible position to adopt). They pretend they believe in the above quotation from Russell.

大多数数学家在日常进行数学运算时都倾向于柏拉图学派，但当被问及他们正在做什么时，他们通常会转而支持形式主义学派，并声称数学是一种无意义的消遣游戏，其符号本身没有任何意义（这并非他们真的相信如此，但这却是一个可以采纳的、很好的且站得住脚的观点）。他们假装相信上面引用的罗素的话。

However, as you all know, mathematics is remarkably useful in this world, and we have been using it without much thought. Hence we need more discussion on this background material you have used without the benefit of thought.

然而，正如大家所知，数学在现实世界中具有显著的实用价值，我们也在日常生活中频繁地运用数学，但往往并未深入思考其原理。因此，对于你们在没有充分思考的情况下所使用的这些背景知识，我们需要进行更深入的探讨。

The ancient Greeks believed mathematics was "truth." There was little or no doubt on this matter in their minds. What is more sure than 1 + 1 = 2? But recall when we discussed error correcting codes we said 1 + 1 = 0. This multiple use of the same symbols (you can claim the 1s in the two statements are not the same things if you wish) contradicts logical usage. It was probably when the first non-Euclidean geometries arose that mathematicians came face to face with this matter that there could be different systems of mathematics. They use the same words, it is true, such as points, lines, and planes, but apparently the meanings to be attached to the words differ. This is not new to you; when you came to the topic of forces in mechanics and to the addition of forces, you had to recognize scalar addition was not appropriate for vector addition. And the word "work" in physics is not the same as we generally mean in real life.

I have always tried to adopt the philosophy that I will do the best I can in the given circumstances, and after it is all over maybe I will try to see to it that things are better next time. This school is not perfect, but for each class I try to do as well as I can and not spend my effort trying to reform every small blemish in the system. I did change Bell Telephone Laboratories significantly, but did not spend much effort on trivial details. I let others do that if they wanted to—but I got on with the main task as I saw it. Do you want to be a reformer of the trivia of your old organization or a creator of the new organization? Pick your choice, but be clear which path you are going down.

一个拙劣的工匠才会抱怨工具不好。我一直以来的处世哲学是：在既定条件下尽力而为，事后则着手改进，力求下次做得更好。这所学校并不完美，但我尽力上好每一堂课，而不是把精力耗费在试图改变体制中的细枝末节上。我曾大幅度改革贝尔电话实验室，但没有在琐碎的细节上花费过多精力。如果别人想做那些事，就让他们去做，我则专注于我认为的主要任务。你想成为旧组织的琐事改革者，还是新组织的创建者？做出你的选择，但务必清楚自己正在走哪条路。

I must come to the topic of "selling" new ideas. You must master three things to do this (Chapter 5):

我必须谈谈如何「推销」新想法。要做到这一点，你必须掌握三件事（第 5 章）：

1 Giving formal presentations,

进行正式演示，

2 Producing written reports, and

撰写书面报告，以及

3 Mastering the art of informal presentations as they happen to occur.

掌握如何即兴进行非正式演讲的技巧。

All three are essential—you must learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because it was not well presented the first time, years before! New ideas are automatically resisted by the establishment, and to some extent justly. The organization cannot be in a continual state of ferment and change, but it should respond to significant changes.

这三点都至关重要 —— 你必须学会推销你的想法，不是靠宣传，而是凭借清晰的表达。我很抱歉不得不指出这一点；许多科学家和其他人认为好的想法会自动脱颖而出，不需要仔细地呈现。他们错了；许多好的想法之所以不得不被重新发现，就是因为它们在多年前第一次出现时没有被很好地呈现出来！新的想法自然会受到既有体系的抵制，这在某种程度上也是合理的。一个组织不能总是处于持续的动荡和变化之中，但它应该对重大变化做出响应。

Change does not mean progress, but progress requires change.

I read up on it a bit, and then thought a great deal. There are, I am told, some 467 theorems in Euclid, but not one of these theorems turned out to be false after Hilbert added his postulates! Yet every theorem which needed one of these new postulates could not have been rigorously "proved" by Euclid! Every theorem which followed, and rested on such a theorem, was also not "proved" by Euclid. Yet the results in the improved system were still the same as those Euclid regarded as being true. How could this be? How could it be that Euclid, though he had not actually proved the bulk of his theorems, never made a mistake? Luck? Hardly!

当这个事实引起我的注意时，我正在攻读数学研究生。我查阅了一些相关资料，并进行了深入的思考。据了解，欧几里得的著作中大约有 467 个定理。令人惊讶的是，在希尔伯特补充了他的公理系统后，这些定理没有一个被推翻！然而，任何一个依赖于希尔伯特新公理的定理，欧几里得都无法严格地「证明」。那些建立在这些未被「证明」的定理之上的后续定理，同样也没有被欧几里得「证明」。尽管如此，改进后的公理系统得出的结论，仍然与欧几里得认为正确的结论一致。这怎么会这样呢？欧几里得虽然没有真正证明他的大部分定理，但为何从未犯错？仅仅是运气好吗？这显然不是！

It soon became evident to me that one of the reasons no theorem was false was that Hilbert "knew" the Euclidean theorems were "correct," and he had picked his added postulates so this would be true. But then I soon realized Euclid had been in the same position; Euclid knew the "truth" of the Pythagorean theorem, and many other theorems, and had to find a system of postulates which would let him get the results he knew in advance. Euclid did not lay down postulates and make deductions as it is commonly taught; he felt his way back from "known" results to the postulates he needed!

我很快就意识到，之所以没有错误的定理，其中一个原因是希尔伯特「知道」欧几里得定理是「正确」的，因此他挑选的公设确保了这一点。但我也很快意识到，欧几里得也面临同样的情况；他早已知道勾股定理以及许多其他定理的「正确性」，因此必须找到一套公设系统，从而推导出他预先知晓的结论。欧几里得并非像通常教导的那样，先提出公设再进行推导，而是从「已知」的结果出发，反向推导出他所需要的公设！

To paraphrase one of Hilbert's claims, "When rigor enters, meaning departs." The formalists claim there is no "meaning" in mathematics—but if so, why should society support mathematics and mathematicians? Why is it mathematics has proved to be so useful? If there is no meaning in any place in all of mathematics, then why is it postulates and definitions are altered in time? The formalists simply cannot explain why mathematics is in fact more than an idle game with no more meaning than the moves of chess.

It turned out zone melting was just what we needed to purify materials for transistors, for example, and it has proved to be essential in many areas of work. He ended up with all the prizes in the field, much more articulate as his confidence grew, and the other day I found his old lab is now a part of a national monument! Ability comes in many forms, and on the surface the variety is great; below the surface there are many common elements.

所以我帮助了比尔·普凡（Bill Pfann），教他如何使用计算机，如何获得他所研究问题的数值解，并让他拥有他所需的所有机时。事实证明，区域熔炼（zone melting）正是我们所需要的，例如，它可以用来提纯制造晶体管的材料，并且它在许多工作领域中被证明是必不可少的。他最终获得了该领域的所有荣誉，随着信心的增长，他的表达也更加清晰流畅了，前几天我发现他以前的实验室现在已成为国家纪念碑的一部分！能力以多种形式出现，表面上看差异很大；但其本质却有很多共通之处。

Having disposed of the psychological objections of luck and the lack of high-iq-type brains, let us go on to how to do great things. Among the important properties to have is the belief you can do important things. If you do not work on important problems, how can you expect to do important work? Yet direct observation and direct questioning of people show most scientists spend most of their time working on things they believe are not important and are not likely to lead to important things.

抛开运气和缺乏高智商这类心理因素不谈，我们来探讨如何成就伟业。其中一个重要的特质就是，你要相信自己能做出重要的成就。如果你不着手解决重要的问题，又怎能期望做出重要的工作？然而，直接观察和询问人们的结果显示，大多数科学家的大部分时间，都花在他们自己也认为不重要、不太可能带来重大突破的事情上。

As an example, after I had been eating for some years with the physics table at the Bell Telephone Laboratories restaurant, fame, promotion, and hiring by other companies ruined the average quality of the people, so I shifted to the chemistry table in another corner of the restaurant. I began by asking what the important problems were in chemistry, then later what important problems they were working on, and finally one day said, "If what you are working on is not important and not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?" After that I was not welcome and had to shift to eating with the engineers! That was in the spring, and in the fall one of the chemists stopped me in the hall and said, "What you said caused me to think for the whole summer about what the important problems are in my field, and while I have not changed my research it was well worth the effort." I thanked him and went on—and noticed in a few months he was made head of the group. About ten years ago I saw he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. No other person at the table did I ever hear of, and no other person was capable of responding to the question I had asked: "Why are you not working on and thinking about the important problems in your area?" If you do not work on important problems, then it is obvious you have little chance of doing important things.

Richard W. Hamming.(2020.1997).2025002The-Art-of-Doing-Science-and-Engineering.Stripe Press => 2501Creativity

## 2501. Creativity

创造力

Creativity, originality, novelty, and other such words are regarded as "good things," and we often fail to distinguish between them—indeed, we find them hard to define. Surely we do not need three words with exactly the same meaning. Hence we should try to differentiate somewhat between them as we try to define them. The importance of definitions has been stressed before, and we will use this occasion to illustrate an approach to defining things, not that we will succeed perfectly or even well.

创造力（Creativity）、原创性（originality）、新颖性（novelty）以及其他类似的词语都被认为是「好东西」，我们常常难以区分它们，实际上，我们发现它们很难定义。显然，我们不需要三个意思完全相同的词。因此，在尝试定义它们时，我们应该尝试区分它们之间的差异。定义的重要性之前已经强调过，我们将借此机会阐述一种定义事物的方法，并非意味着我们能完美甚至良好地完成这项工作。

It should be remarked that in primitive societies creativity, originality, and novelty are not appreciated; doing as one's ancestors did is the proper thing to do. This is also true in many large organizations today: the elders are sure they know how the future should be handled and the younger members of the tribe, when they do things differently, are not appreciated.

需要注意的是，在原始社会中，创造力、原创性和新颖性并不受重视；遵循祖先的传统才是正道。这种情况在当今许多大型组织中也很常见：年长者认为他们知道如何应对未来，而年轻成员如果尝试不同的做事方式，则不被认可。

Long ago a friend of mine in computing once remarked that he would like to do something original with a computer, something no one else had ever done. I promptly replied, "Take a random ten-decimal-digit number and multiply it by another random ten-digit number, and it will almost certainly be something no one else has ever done." There are, using back-of-the-envelope computing, about 8.5×1018 such products, and with only around 3×1016 nanoseconds in a year you can estimate the odds of it being an original product. Naturally he was not pleased with the suggestion, but he would have gladly settled for computing the largest known prime number up to that time! Why the difference? Why would one number go into a record book, at least temporarily, and not the other? For one thing, records require either a great deal of effort to accomplish or else a remarkable coincidence, and the random multiplication had neither so far as the average person can see. Evidently "not done before" is hardly enough to make anything important or original. "Originality" seems to be more than not having been done before.

Shannon did a lot of important things besides information theory—his master's thesis was applying Boolean algebra to switching circuits! Einstein did many great things, not just one or two. For example, when he was around 12–14 years old, he asked himself what light would look like if he went at the velocity of light. He would, apparently, see a local peak, yet the corresponding mathematical equations would not support a stationary extreme! An obvious contradiction! Is it surprising he later discovered special relativity, which was in the air and which many people were working on at that time? He had prepared himself long ago, by that early question, to understand better than the others what was going on and how to approach it.

如果成功主要靠的是运气，那么伟大的成就就不应该总是由同一批人反复创造。香农的贡献远不止信息论，他的硕士论文就将布尔代数巧妙地应用到了开关电路中！爱因斯坦的伟大成就更是数不胜数，绝非一两件。比如，在他大约 12 到 14 岁时，他就开始思考这样一个问题：如果自己以光速运动，光看起来会是什么样子？他意识到自己会看到一个局部的波峰，但这与描述静止状态下光波的数学方程式相矛盾！这简直是一个明显的悖论！那么，他后来发现狭义相对论，也就不足为奇了吧？要知道，当时很多人都在研究这个领域，狭义相对论的诞生可谓呼之欲出。而爱因斯坦，正是通过早年对这个问题的深入思考，比其他人更早、更深刻地理解了其中的奥秘，并找到了解决之道。

Newton observed that if others would think as hard as he did, then they would be able to do the same things. Edison said genius was 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. It is hard work, applied for long years, which leads to the creative act, and it is rarely just handed to you without any serious effort on your part. Yes, sometimes it just happens, and then it is pure luck. It seems to me to be folly for you to depend solely on luck for the outcome of this one life you have to lead.

牛顿认为，如果其他人能像他一样勤奋思考，他们也能取得同样的成就。爱迪生曾说，天才就是 99% 的汗水加上 1% 的灵感。创造性的行为往往源于长年累月的艰苦付出，很少有成果是不经过认真努力就能轻易获得的。当然，有时候灵感会突然降临，但这纯粹是运气。在我看来，仅仅依赖运气来决定你这一生的走向是不可取的。

One of the characteristics you see is that great people when young were generally active—though Newton did not seem exceptional until well into his undergraduate days at Cambridge, Einstein was not a great student, and many other great people were not at the top of their class.
